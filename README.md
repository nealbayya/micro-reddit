# Micro-Reddit

## Why
I am building this application to learn more about database models and familiarize myself with Active Record in Ruby on Rails.

## About
 The finished product will allow users to authenticate, make posts, and contribute to threaded comments. I will also attempt to implement the upvote feature of Reddit, which will sort the comments tree by popularity.
